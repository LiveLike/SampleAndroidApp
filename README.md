# SampleAndroidApp
This code will help you all to integrate LiveLike mobile SDK. 

Follow the below steps for easy integration 

1. You would need to register your application at our Producer Suite (https://producer.livelikecdn.com/)

2. You will be needing a Client id for initializing the Android Engagement SDK

3. A Content Session represents a user's subscription to a particular program (typically a live, linear TV show, game or episode). To start a Content Session you will need a Program ID. Integrating teams are expected to create programs within the LiveLike system, either through the API or through the Producer Suite. The team should then copy the Program IDs into the relevant media metadata in their own systems, so that content sessions can be started along with media playback.

4. Kindly enter client id and program id on the app and click on Save button.

5. After saving the above ids, you can go to Chat or Widget section to experience our widget and chat functionality.
